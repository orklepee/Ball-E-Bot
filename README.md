<h1>Ball-E Bot v.0.1:</h1>

<h3>This program uses "Ball-E": pygame.org/project/1072/1916</h3>
<h3>This program's algorithm was taken from Frogger-AI-bot: github.com/pecurka/Frogger-AI-bot</h3>

The following program was created by Samuel Vierling, Alex Robinson, and Morgan Mussoline.
The algorithm from Frogger-AI-bot was fit to the Ball-E game and altered for it to serve its purpose.

The point of the bot is to show how a generational algorithm can work with collision as opposed to
its service in Frogger where an upwards movement on the Y-axis returned a +1 fitness for the frog.
The bot is also good for students to research.

We recommend using 2-3 players at a time. Any more starts to create a barrier which sort of defeats
the whole purpose.
